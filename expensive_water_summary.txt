Row count: 16

Part 1
Step 9
In this part, I created a python file (filter.py) using the provided code. I made sure this python file can be run/executed from the terminal. I then used "curl" to download all the data on the 2017 quarter 1 file from the website. And by piping it into the python file, the python file can use the data on the 2017 file as an input and print out the desired results according to the python code, which in this case, is every row that shows spending more than 1000 USD on water purpose. I then put all the rows that fit the criteria into a csv file (expensive_water.csv) that can be read by Excel. By piping the csv file into csvstat, the csv file becomes an input to csvstat, and this can provide a text file for the readers to see the summary of the csv file. The summary is presented by listing each column of the csv file separately and the information on each column is shown.

In other ways, we can also think all the steps as I download the 2017 quarter 1 file and filter the PURPOSE column using "WATER" and filter the AMOUNT column using "greater than 1000." This filtered file should match the expensive_water csv file created by using the terminal and python file.
